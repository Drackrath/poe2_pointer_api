# poe2_pointer_api

This project aims to provide application creators with a live-data feed from a running Path of Exile 2 client. The code is intended for white/grey zone use only and not for malicious intent. It does not alter game data or create software that gives players a significant advantage beyond the average game experience.

## Current Stage of Development
- [x] Research on how to retrieve pointers
- [x] Research on whether pointers of Path of Exile are persistent through different sessions
- Research on whether pointers are persistent on different machines // Needs Other Contributors
- Research on whether pointers are persistent through changing releases // Needs game update
- [x] //ON HOLD// Research on which pointers are persistent to be beneficial
  - Retrieve all possible pointers and classify
- [x] //CURRENT STAGE// Research how to access THREADSTACK0 via Python
- Wrap all pointers with Getters
- Write Documentation
- Write Comments
